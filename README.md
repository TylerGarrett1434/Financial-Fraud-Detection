# 🕵️‍♀️ Financial Fraud Detection with Machine Learning

This project applies various machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). Fraudulent transactions are rare, so the dataset is highly imbalanced, making it a great use case for anomaly detection and precision-focused modeling.
